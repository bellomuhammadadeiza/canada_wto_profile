# Canada's Strategic Position on WTO Agricultural Trade Negotiation
## Project Overview
This project simulated a partial WTO agriculture negotiation, allowing participants to apply trade policy concepts in a practical setting. 

### Case Study 
- The case study focused on a U.S. proposal to cut agricultural subsidies through reductions in Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS) commitments.
- The proposal included a 20% cut to final bound AMS for WTO members with existing commitments, phased in over three years.
- De minimis support levels for developed countries from 5% to 1% and for developing countries from 10% to 2%, with least-developed countries exempt.
- Assumption that AMS exemptions for public food stockholding would end in 2027.  

The simulation required participants to assume the role of their countryâ€™s WTO representative and determine their stance within 15 minutes. They analyzed how the proposal would impact their domestic agricultural policies, market access, and political landscape while considering potential alliances and negotiation strategies. The urgency of the negotiation was heightened by the U.S. threat to withdraw from the WTO and impose unilateral tariffs if no agreement was reached.
